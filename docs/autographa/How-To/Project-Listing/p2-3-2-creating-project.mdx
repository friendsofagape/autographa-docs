The ‘Create Project’ screen is designed specifically for the type of project you are creating. Now, Autographa supports **Text Translation editing mode** and **OBS Translation editing mode**.
To create a new Translation project, you may:

- Click on the **New Project** Icon  <img src="/autographaAssetsV2/how-to/new-project.png" width="50px" alt=""/>  on the left column on the screen.
- Click on the drop-down button <img src="/autographaAssetsV2/how-to/translatio-mode.png" width="50px" alt=""/> on the top left side near the project name to choose the translation editing mode. By default, the system selects **Text Translation Editing Mode**.
- On this page, you can edit specific project details like:
  - Project Name
  - Project Description 
  - Target Language 
    - Change the target language by clicking on the drop-down menu and selecting one from the list of available languages. 	

- Click on **Create Project.**

Once a project is created, it will appear as a new item on the project listing page. You can click on the project name in the list to start editing the project.
